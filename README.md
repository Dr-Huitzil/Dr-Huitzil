# About me:
I am a design-minded developer with an extensive background in customer service and jobs that have nothing to do with computer science. I believe any job will allow me to develop[ skills that will one day come in handy. I am currently a student at California State University - Monterey Bay pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.
